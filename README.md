Simple CDK project to test performance of bundling Lambda code. Package consist of a single CDK stack `SimpleStack` with a very simple lambda function.

## Usage

* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Run tests: `npm run test`
* Synthesize app: `npx cdk synth`

## Performance issue description

Parcel bundling is slow (takes 6-8 seconds for a lambda with no logic) and the Parcel cache doesn't seem to work properly. To demonstrate this, run the test, it will perform two tests on the same stack which results in the lambda being bundled twice. I would expect that bundling is almost instant for the second test as Parcel cached it.

Example test output:
```
Bundling asset simple-stack/HandlerLambda/Code/Stage...

 RUNS  lib/simple-stack.test.ts
✨ Built in 8.01s

  Simple Stack
    ✓ Should have memory size set to 512MB (9505 ms)
    ✓ Should use Node 12 as runtime (7459 ms)

## Solution
Just avoid using `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-nodejs` and use for example the [`aws-lambda-nodejs-esbuild`](https://github.com/floydspace/aws-lambda-nodejs-esbuild) instead

Example test output:
```
 PASS  lib/simple-stack.test.ts
  Simple Stack
    ✓ Should have memory size set to 512MB (154 ms)
    ✓ Should use Node 12 as runtime (57 ms)
